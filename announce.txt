The following packages have been updated in the Cygwin distribution:

Emacs is a powerful, customizable, self-documenting, modeless text editor.  Emacs contains special code editing features, a scripting language (elisp), and the capability to read mail, news, and more without leaving the editor.

This is a rebuild of release 24.4-2, to eliminate the dependence on obsolete libraries.

For more information about emacs-24.4, see the release announcement for emacs-24.4-1:
