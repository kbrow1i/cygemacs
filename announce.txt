The following packages have been updated in the Cygwin distribution:

* emacs-24.4-3
* emacs-X11-24.4-3
* emacs-w32-24.4-3
* emacs-el-24.4-3

Emacs is a powerful, customizable, self-documenting, modeless text editor.  Emacs contains special code editing features, a scripting language (elisp), and the capability to read mail, news, and more without leaving the editor.

This is a rebuild of release 24.4-2 to eliminate the dependence on obsolete libraries.
