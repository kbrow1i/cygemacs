The following packages have been updated in the Cygwin distribution:

*** emacs-24.4-1
*** emacs-X11-24.4-1
*** emacs-w32-24.4-1
*** emacs-el-24.4-1

Emacs is a powerful, customizable, self-documenting, modeless text editor.  Emacs contains special code editing features, a scripting language (elisp), and the capability to read mail, news, and more without leaving the editor.

This is a new upstream release.  It contains bugfixes as well as new features.  Browse the NEWS file ('C-h n' within emacs) for information about changes since emacs-24.3.  In particular, there are noticeable changes involving indentation.

In view of the mysterious crashes that some users have reported on 64-bit Cygwin, I have built the 64-bit Emacs packages with more optimization than usual (-Og instead of -O2), for easier debugging; I have also enabled some extra checking.  I hope there will not be a substantial performance penalty, but we do need to get to the bottom of these crashes.  More information about debugging Emacs can be found in /usr/share/doc/emacs/README.Cygwin.

CYGWIN NOTES
============
1. The emacs, emacs-w32, and emacs-X11 packages each provide an Emacs binary.  These are emacs-nox.exe, emacs-w32.exe, and emacs-X11.exe, respectively, in order of increasing priority.  The postinstall scripts use the `alternatives' system to create a symlink /usr/bin/emacs that resolves to the highest-priority binary that you have installed.  Thus the command `emacs' will start emacs-X11.exe if you've installed the emacs-X11 package; otherwise, it will start emacs-w32.exe if you've installed emacs-w32; otherwise, it will start emacs-nox.exe.  Similar remarks apply to emacsclient.

If you have installed both emacs-w32 and emacs-X11 and prefer to give higher priority to emacs-w32, run the script

  /usr/bin/set-emacs-default-w32.sh

You can later restore emacs-X11 as the default by running

  /usr/bin/set-emacs-default-X11.sh

2. Install emacs-X11 if you want to use the X11 GUI.  You can then type `emacs&' in an xterm window, and emacs will start in a new window.

3. Install emacs-w32 if you want to use the native Windows GUI instead of X11.

4. If you have sshd running and want to be able to run emacs-X11 from a remote machine, you need to enable X11 forwarding by adding the following line to /etc/sshd_config:

  X11Forwarding yes

You might also need to have the cygserver service running.

5. The script /usr/bin/make-emacs-shortcut can be used to create a shortcut for starting emacs.  See /usr/share/doc/emacs/README.Cygwin for details.
