Subject: emacs 26.1.92-3 (TEST)

The following packages have been uploaded to the Cygwin distribution
as test releases:

* emacs-26.1.92-3
* emacs-common-26.1.92-3
* emacs-X11-26.1.92-3
* emacs-w32-26.1.92-3
* emacs-lucid-26.1.92-3

Emacs is a powerful, customizable, self-documenting, modeless text
editor.  Emacs contains special code editing features, a scripting
language (elisp), and the capability to read mail, news, and more
without leaving the editor.

This is a pretest for the upcoming release of emacs-26.2.  Browse the
NEWS file ('C-h n' within emacs) for changes since the last release,
although this is not yet complete.

This build uses the timerfd functions that were introduced in
cygwin-3.0.0, so it will not run on earlier releases of Cygwin.  And
it will not run well on Cygwin releases prior to cygwin-3.0.3, which
contains fixes for some timer-related bugs.

CYGWIN NOTES
============

1. The emacs, emacs-w32, emacs-X11, and emacs-lucid packages each
   provide an emacs binary.  These are emacs-nox.exe, emacs-w32.exe,
   emacs-X11.exe, and emacs-lucid.exe, respectively, in order of
   increasing priority.  The postinstall scripts create a symlink
   /usr/bin/emacs that resolves to the highest-priority binary that
   you have installed.  Thus the command 'emacs' will start
   emacs-lucid.exe if you've installed the emacs-lucid package;
   otherwise, it will start emacs-X11.exe if you've installed
   emacs-X11; otherwise, it will start emacs-w32.exe if you've
   installed emacs-w32; otherwise, it will start emacs-nox.exe if
   you've installed emacs.  Similar remarks apply to emacsclient.

   You only need to install one of these four packages, but you can
   install more if you want.  If you have installed more than one and
   don't like the default resolution of /usr/bin/emacs, you can run
   one of the /usr/bin/set-emacs-default-*.sh scripts to change it.
   For example,

     /usr/bin/set-emacs-default-w32.sh

   will make /usr/bin/emacs resolve to /usr/bin/emacs-w32.exe,
   regardless of which packages you've installed.

2. The emacs-common package is new with this release.  It contains the
   files that are needed by all four of the binary packages mentioned
   above.  It also contains the elisp source files, which were
   previously in a separate (now obsolete) emacs-el package.

3. Install emacs-X11 if you want to use the X11 GUI with the GTK+
   toolkit.  (This is the default toolkit.)  You can then type
   'emacs&' in an xterm window, and emacs-X11.exe will start in a new
   window.  If you prefer the Lucid toolkit, install emacs-lucid
   instead.

4. Install emacs-w32 if you want to use the native Windows GUI instead
   of X11.

5. If you use the Emacs MH-E library for email, consider installing
   Cygwin's mailutils-mh package.  To use it, put the line

     (load "mailutils-mh")

   in your site-start.el or ~/.emacs file.

6. If you have sshd running and want to be able to run emacs-X11 from
   a remote machine, you need to enable X11 forwarding by adding the
   following line to /etc/sshd_config:

     X11Forwarding yes

   You might also need to have the cygserver service running.

7. The script /usr/bin/make-emacs-shortcut can be used to create a
   shortcut for starting emacs.  See
   /usr/share/doc/emacs/README.Cygwin for details.
