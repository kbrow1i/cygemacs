Subject: emacs 25.2-1

The following packages have been uploaded to the Cygwin distribution:

* emacs-25.2-1
* emacs-el-25.2-1
* emacs-X11-25.2-1
* emacs-w32-25.2-1

Emacs is a powerful, customizable, self-documenting, modeless text
editor.  Emacs contains special code editing features, a scripting
language (elisp), and the capability to read mail, news, and more
without leaving the editor.

This is an update to the latest upstream release.  It should be
identical to the 25.2-0.1 release except for documentation changes.
Compared to emacs-25.1, this is mainly a bugfix release, but there are
some other changes.  Browse the NEWS file ('C-h n' within emacs) for
details.

CYGWIN NOTES
============

1. The emacs, emacs-w32, and emacs-X11 packages each provide an Emacs
   binary.  These are emacs-nox.exe, emacs-w32.exe, and emacs-X11.exe,
   respectively, in order of increasing priority.  The postinstall
   scripts use the 'alternatives' system to create a symlink
   /usr/bin/emacs that resolves to the highest-priority binary that
   you have installed.  Thus the command 'emacs' will start
   emacs-X11.exe if you've installed the emacs-X11 package; otherwise,
   it will start emacs-w32.exe if you've installed emacs-w32;
   otherwise, it will start emacs-nox.exe.  Similar remarks apply to
   emacsclient.

   If you have installed both emacs-w32 and emacs-X11 and prefer to
   give higher priority to emacs-w32, run the script

     /usr/bin/set-emacs-default-w32.sh

   You can later restore emacs-X11 as the default by running

     /usr/bin/set-emacs-default-X11.sh

2. Install emacs-X11 if you want to use the X11 GUI.  You can then
   type 'emacs&' in an xterm window, and emacs will start in a new
   window.

3. Install emacs-w32 if you want to use the native Windows GUI instead
   of X11.

4. If you use the Emacs Rmail library, consider installing Cygwin's
   mailutils package.  It provides a utility /usr/bin/movemail.exe
   that has more features and is more secure than the version provided
   by emacs (and installed under /usr/libexec/emacs).

   If you use the Emacs MH-E library, consider installing Cygwin's
   mailutils-mh package.  To use it, put the line

     (load "mailutils-mh")

   in your site-start.el or ~/.emacs file.

5. If you have sshd running and want to be able to run emacs-X11 from
   a remote machine, you need to enable X11 forwarding by adding the
   following line to /etc/sshd_config:

     X11Forwarding yes

   You might also need to have the cygserver service running.

6. The script /usr/bin/make-emacs-shortcut can be used to create a
   shortcut for starting emacs.  See
   /usr/share/doc/emacs/README.Cygwin for details.
