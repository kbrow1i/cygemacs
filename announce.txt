The following packages have been updated in the Cygwin distribution:

* emacs-24.4-2
* emacs-X11-24.4-2
* emacs-w32-24.4-2
* emacs-el-24.4-2

Emacs is a powerful, customizable, self-documenting, modeless text editor.  Emacs contains special code editing features, a scripting language (elisp), and the capability to read mail, news, and more without leaving the editor.

This is a rebuild of release 24.4-1, with two changes to reflect the fact that the cause of the mysterious crashes has been found and fixed (https://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2014-10/msg00397.html).  First, the 64-bit packages are now built with the usual optimization and without extra checking.  Second, I have enabled file-notification [*].  I had previously disabled this because it requires Glib, and I didn't want to make Emacs depend on an additional library until the cause of the crashes was found.

For more information about emacs-24.4, see the release announcement for emacs-24.4-1:
