The following packages have been updated in the Cygwin distribution as test releases:

*** emacs-24.2.93-1
*** emacs-X11-24.2.93-1
*** emacs-w32-24.2.93-1
*** emacs-el-24.2.93-1

Emacs is a powerful, customizable, self-documenting, modeless text editor.  Emacs contains special code editing features, a scripting language (elisp), and the capability to read mail, news, and more without leaving the editor.

This release is a pretest for the upcoming emacs-24.3.  It contains bugfixes as well as new features.  In particular, it fixes the bug reported in

  http://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2013-02/msg00008.html

Browse the NEWS file (`C-h n' within emacs) for information about upstream changes since emacs-24.2.

emacs-X11 now supports GNOME's GSettings and GConf features.  As a consequence, it is important that you have a D-Bus session daemon running before starting emacs under X11.  Otherwise, emacs will try to start one, and this can cause problems.

A simple way to make sure that a D-Bus session daemon is running is to start it in your ~/.startxwinc file.  If you already have a ~/.startxwinc file that starts an xterm process (and perhaps emacs), just add the following line at the beginning:

  eval `dbus-launch --sh-syntax`

Otherwise, create one containing the following two lines:

  eval `dbus-launch --sh-syntax`
  xterm &

You can then start emacs from the xterm window that opens up.

Alternatively, put the following three lines in ~/.bashrc (assuming you use bash as your shell):

  if [ -n "$DISPLAY" ] && [ -z "$DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS" ] ; then
      eval `dbus-launch --sh-syntax`
  fi

For more information, see the documentation for dbus-launch.

A second consequence is that you might see a GTK warning about gtk_window_parse_geometry; this can be ignored.

CYGWIN NOTES
============
1. The emacs, emacs-w32, and emacs-X11 packages each provide an emacs binary.  These are emacs-nox.exe, emacs-w32.exe, and emacs-X11.exe, respectively, in order of increasing priority.  The postinstall scripts create a symlink /usr/bin/emacs that resolves to the highest-priority binary that you have installed.  Thus the command `emacs' will start emacs-X11.exe if you've installed the emacs-X11 package; otherwise, it will start emacs-w32.exe if you've installed emacs-w32; otherwise, it will start emacs-nox.exe.

2. Install emacs-X11 if you want to use the X11 GUI.  You can then type `emacs&' in an xterm window, and emacs will start in a new window.

3. Install emacs-w32 if you want to use the native Windows GUI instead of X11.

4. If you have sshd running and want to be able to run emacs-X11 from a remote machine, you need to enable X11 forwarding by adding the following line to /etc/sshd_config:

  X11Forwarding yes

You might also need to have the cygserver service running.

5. The script /usr/bin/make-emacs-shortcut can be used to create a shortcut for starting emacs.  See /usr/share/doc/emacs/README.Cygwin for details.

6. The default font for emacs-w32 is not very attractive in my opinion.  See /usr/share/doc/emacs/README.Cygwin for hints as to how to change it.
