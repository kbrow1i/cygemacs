Subject: emacs 26.1-1

The following packages have been uploaded to the Cygwin distribution:

* emacs-26.1-1
* emacs-el-26.1-1
* emacs-X11-26.1-1
* emacs-w32-26.1-1
* emacs-lucid-26.1-1 [*]

Emacs is a powerful, customizable, self-documenting, modeless text
editor.  Emacs contains special code editing features, a scripting
language (elisp), and the capability to read mail, news, and more
without leaving the editor.

This is an update to the latest upstream release.  Browse the NEWS
file ('C-h n' within emacs) for changes since the last release.


CYGWIN NOTES
============

1. The emacs, emacs-w32, emacs-X11, and emacs-lucid packages each
   provide an emacs binary.  These are emacs-nox.exe, emacs-w32.exe,
   emacs-X11.exe, and emacs-lucid.exe, respectively, in order of
   increasing priority.  The postinstall scripts create a symlink
   /usr/bin/emacs that resolves to the highest-priority binary that
   you have installed.  Thus the command 'emacs' will start
   emacs-lucid.exe if you've installed the emacs-lucid package;
   otherwise, it will start emacs-X11.exe if you've installed
   emacs-X11; otherwise, it will start emacs-w32.exe if you've
   installed emacs-w32; otherwise, it will start emacs-nox.exe.
   Similar remarks apply to emacsclient.

   If you have installed more than one emacs package and don't like
   the default resolution of /usr/bin/emacs, you can run one of the
   /usr/bin/set-emacs-default-*.sh scripts to change it.  For example,

     /usr/bin/set-emacs-default-w32.sh

   will make /usr/bin/emacs resolve to /usr/bin/emacs-w32.exe,
   regardless of which packages you've installed.

2. Install emacs-X11 if you want to use the X11 GUI with the GTK+
   toolkit.  (This is the default toolkit.)  You can then type
   'emacs&' in an xterm window, and emacs-X11.exe will start in a new
   window.  If you prefer the Lucid toolkit, install emacs-lucid
   instead.

3. Install emacs-w32 if you want to use the native Windows GUI instead
   of X11.

4. If you use the Emacs MH-E library for email, consider installing
   Cygwin's mailutils-mh package.  To use it, put the line

     (load "mailutils-mh")

   in your site-start.el or ~/.emacs file.

5. If you have sshd running and want to be able to run emacs-X11 from
   a remote machine, you need to enable X11 forwarding by adding the
   following line to /etc/sshd_config:

     X11Forwarding yes

   You might also need to have the cygserver service running.

6. The script /usr/bin/make-emacs-shortcut can be used to create a
   shortcut for starting emacs.  See
   /usr/share/doc/emacs/README.Cygwin for details.
